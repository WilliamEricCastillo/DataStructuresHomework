# Coding 02 - Classes and Objects

This repository contains a C++ application to demonstrate classes and objects.

## Introduction

This C++ application illustrates the concepts of classes and objects by implementing a simple program that calculates properties of circles and spheres. It includes classes for Circle and Sphere, along with functions to display their properties.

## Files

- **functions.cpp**: Contains functions to display properties of circles and spheres.
- **functions.h**: Header file declaring function prototypes.
- **main.cpp**: Main program file demonstrating the use of classes and objects.
- **main.h**: Header file including necessary includes for the main program.
- **sphere.cpp**: Implementation file for the Sphere class.
- **sphere.h**: Header file for the Sphere class.
- **circle.cpp**: Implementation file for the Circle class.
- **circle.h**: Header file for the Circle class.

## Usage

To use this application, compile the source files using a C++ compiler and execute the generated executable. The main program demonstrates how to create instances of Circle and Sphere objects and display their properties.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ library
