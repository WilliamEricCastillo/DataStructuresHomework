# Coding 03 - Integer Stack

This repository contains a C++ application to demonstrate a simple Abstract Data Type (ADT) - Stack, and understand its functions and purposes.

## Introduction

This C++ application introduces a simple ADT - Stack, and demonstrates its usage through a main program. It includes implementations of the Stack class and functions to perform operations like push, pop, isEmpty, and peek.

## Files

- **main.cpp**: Main program file demonstrating the usage of the Stack ADT.
- **main.h**: Header file including necessary includes for the main program.
- **stack.cpp**: Implementation file for the Stack class.
- **stack.h**: Header file for the Stack class.

## Usage

To use this application, compile the source files using a C++ compiler and execute the generated executable. The main program demonstrates various operations on the Stack, such as pushing, popping, peeking, and checking for empty stack.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ library
