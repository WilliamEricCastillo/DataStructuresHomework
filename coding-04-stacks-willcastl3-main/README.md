# Coding 04 - Stacks

This repository contains a C++ application to demonstrate the implementation of a stack data structure with a custom data type.

## Introduction

This C++ application implements a stack data structure that works with a custom data type called `Data`. The `Data` struct simulates the idea of an abstract data type (ADT) containing an identifier and some information. The stack is implemented using a dynamic array of `Data` pointers.

## Files

- **data.h**: Header file defining the `Data` struct.
- **functions.cpp**: Implementation file containing functions to generate and display test cases.
- **functions.h**: Header file containing function declarations.
- **main.cpp**: Main program file demonstrating the usage of the stack data structure.
- **main.h**: Header file including necessary includes for the main program.
- **stack.cpp**: Implementation file for the stack class.
- **stack.h**: Header file for the stack class.

## Usage

To use this application, compile the source files using a C++ compiler and execute the generated executable. The main program demonstrates various operations on the stack, such as pushing, popping, peeking, and checking for empty stack. Additionally, it includes automated tests to verify the functionality of the stack.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ library
