# Coding 06 - Hash Tables

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Hash Table class/object with a standard struct, created by William Castillo.

## File Structure

- `data.h`: Header file containing the definition of the `Data` struct.
- `hashtable.h`: Header file containing the declaration of the `Hashtable` class.
- `hashtable.cpp`: Implementation file for the `Hashtable` class.
- `linkedlist.h`: Header file containing the declaration of the `LinkedList` class.
- `linkedlist.cpp`: Implementation file for the `LinkedList` class.
- `main.h`: Header file containing includes and definitions for the `main.cpp` file.
- `main.cpp`: Main program file demonstrating the usage of the hash table implementation.

## Usage

To use the hash table implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source files using a C++ compiler.
3. Execute the compiled program.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ main.cpp hashtable.cpp linkedlist.cpp -o main
```
To execute the compiled program, use the following command:

```bash
./main
```

## Testing
The main.cpp file contains extensive testing code to demonstrate the functionality of the hash table implementation. 
It generates test data, inserts it into the hash table, performs various operations (insertion, deletion, retrieval), and prints the hash table's contents at different stages.
