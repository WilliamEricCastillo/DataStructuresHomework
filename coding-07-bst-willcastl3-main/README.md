# Coding 07 - Binary Search Tree

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) class/object created by William Castillo. The BST works with the same `Data` and `DataNode` structs used in previous assignments.

## File Structure

- `bintree.h`: Header file containing the declaration of the `BinTree` class.
- `bintree.cpp`: Implementation file for the `BinTree` class.
- `data.h`: Header file containing the definition of the `Data` struct.
- `functions.h`: Header file containing additional function prototypes.
- `functions.cpp`: Implementation file for additional functions.
- `main.h`: Header file containing includes and definitions for the `main.cpp` file.
- `main.cpp`: Main program file demonstrating the usage of the BST implementation.

## Usage

To use the BST implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source files using a C++ compiler.
3. Execute the compiled program.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ main.cpp bintree.cpp functions.cpp -o main
```

To execute the compiled program, use the following command:
```bash
./main
```

## Testing
The main.cpp file contains extensive testing code to demonstrate the functionality of the BST implementation. It includes tests for adding nodes, removing nodes, retrieving nodes, checking if a node exists, displaying the tree, and more.
